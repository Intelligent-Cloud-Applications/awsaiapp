            outside India users. We may run periodic discount offers. The

            You can cancel your subscription at any time without incurring any
            cancellation fees. To cancel your subscription, please log in to
            your account and follow the cancellation process. Your subscription

            Refunds
          </h4>
          <p className="mt-2 sm:ml-0 ml-5 mr-5">
            If the payment for your subscription fails or if we receive
            confirmation from the bank, we will offer a refund. We may also
            offer refunds in certain other circumstances, at our discretion.
            Refunds will be issued to the original payment method used to
            purchase the subscription.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 sm:ml-0 ml-5 mr-5">
            In the event of cancellation of the subscription, you will be
            refunded the remaining subscription amount for the unused portion of
            the month only if you cancel the subscription at least 24 hours
            before the end of the billing cycle. However, if you have taken
            advantage of any discount offers at the time of purchase, the refund
            amount will be calculated based on the discounted amount paid.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-2 sm:ml-0 ml-5 mr-5">
            If you cancel your subscription after the first month or in the
            middle of the month, you will not be eligible for a refund for the
            subscription fee paid for that month. However, you will not be
            charged for any subsequent months.

            offer period, the subscription fee will be charged at the discounted
            rate for the duration of the offer period. If you cancel your
            subscription during the offer period, you will not be eligible for a
